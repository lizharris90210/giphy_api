# giphy_api

Click on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

When clicked, still gif animates. 

Click the gif again, it stops playing.

Under every gif, rating is displayed.
 
When a topic is searched, it is added to the topics array and adds the button to the page.
